Hi! Hello! Xin Chào Jenny!

Great work! 

I've made a few notes that I would like you to fix for your own knowledge and experience - but you have demonstrated you know what you are doing.

Separate CSS files is a fairly large component of what I consider a well organised project and would usually be a "re-submit please", however in styles.css you clearly show which style is for which page. Although you didn't make the separate files a well organised project should have to fix it will simply be a matter of creating the files, cutting and pasting and a bit of a clean up.

So I'm satisfied you have the understanding required for a Välgodkänt grade and I don't need to reassess. But please make those changes for your own knowledge.

Well done!

  For readability & efficiency I would like to see a general css file with common styling (eh heaer, footer, navigation and general container classes), then specific files for individual pages. Right now css for elements such as .about-me-picture is loaded with every page, and it only is relevant to one page.
